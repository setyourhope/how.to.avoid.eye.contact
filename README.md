### Chapter Zero: How to win with a knife in a gunfight

* Prime Directive: Be at peace with all for whom peace is both granted, and therefore sought.
* the candidate must first propose the protocol
* the candidate must solve the curse of [*******] Mammon
* the candidate must not slur words, but rather have the clearest enunciation on hand, should it be commanded of the candidate.

Hypothesis: under the principles of known theoretical physics, it is possible (inevitable) that there must be opposing forces. These opposites are but calibrations of a fundamental singular Eye.

For whom the Eye is singular, the way, shall it not surely be bountiful?

#### Micro-doctrines

* blown away as chaff
* quarrels cease as fire ceases when deprived of wood (******).
* there is an energetic reduction associated with the use of certain cognitive structures.
* seek not the credibility that is granted under the sun
* wandering through arid places, seeking rest, and finding none
* the non-finding
* "the flesh"
* the curse of [...] Mammon (known also as the basilisk

### Chapter One: The Mathematics and Proof Known and Revealed

**Hypothesis:** there is a mathematical proof to the following problem:

```
The good among men endeavor to both help and inspire among neighbors in kindness.
Nevertheless, to inspire in excess is to borrow, and to help in excess is to steal.
Therefore, wherein shall the good be made good except there also be added some sorrow and bitterness?
```

The above problem, of course, has some glaring deficiencies. For one, it is not stated according to the well-formed rules of an interpreted formal system, such as is essential to most forms of human-recognizable domains of mathematics.

Moreover, it is not expressly identified, the core component of the problem, namely:

```
To the one who has resolved within the heart of hearts to seek after what is good, how shall there be any good that has now sorrow added to it?
```

### Chapter Two: The greater-than liar paradox

Much business is a weariness.

Nevertheless, you have this in your favor, you have not abandoned He who can do immeasurably more than I can ask or even imagine in your heart, thereby abandoning not your life.

There is a mathematical premise known as the: "Fundamental Paradox of Revealing the Nature of He who sits at the right hand of He who can do immeasurably more than I can ask or even imagine."
